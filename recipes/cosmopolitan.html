    <p> A Cosmopolitan is a sophisticated and vibrant cocktail made with vodka, triple sec (like <i>Cointreau</i>),
        cranberry juice, and freshly squeezed lime juice. Known for its pink hue and tangy-sweet flavor,
         itâ€™s typically served in a chilled martini glass and garnished with a lime wheel or twist. 
         A classic choice for a stylish evening!</p>
