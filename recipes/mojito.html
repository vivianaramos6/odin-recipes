    <p>A Mojito is a refreshing Cuban cocktail made with white rum, fresh mint leaves,
         lime juice, sugar, and soda water. It’s typically served over ice, with muddled mint 
         and lime providing a crisp, citrusy, and slightly sweet flavor. Perfect for warm weather, 
         it’s known for its balance of sweetness, tartness, and herbal notes.</p>
